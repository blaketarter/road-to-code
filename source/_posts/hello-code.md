# Hello Code!

Hi there! Im Blake Tarter, I'm currently a developer working at CodeKoalas. One of my coworkers decided to convince me to do 100 Days of Code, and I figured "Well this is the perfect excuse to get me to try blogging out."

```javascript
console.log('Hello World!');
```

## What the heck is this?

Short answer is I have no idea. And the long answer is just wait and see what happens.

My goal with this blog is to keep me (and potentially others) accountable publically on the 100 Days of Code challenge. We'll see how it goes!
